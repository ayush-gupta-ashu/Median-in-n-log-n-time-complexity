# Median-in-n-log-n-time-complexity
For nlog(n) time complexity first do either merge sort or quick sort or quick sort 3 way partition and then find nth order statistic or median
Do make appropiate changes to find nth order statistic in leniar time in my code as code is designed for finding median.
